A funny quirk about humans is that we often don’t really know why we make the decisions we make, but we are very good at coming up with reasons that SOUND good after the fact to explain our decisions. For example, when asked why I chose to study data science; I can with confidence take you through the twists and turns in my life that led me here. As for the actual REASONS, well that took more than a few minutes of reflection.  The three reasons I came up with for why I wanted to study data science are: it seemed really interesting; I thought I would be good at it, and it is an in-demand skill.

My interest in data science did not come completely out of the blue. I have a BSc in Biology and I have worked for years as an analytical chemist. An interest in bioinformatics drew me back to college to study computer science. The idea of studying genetics in silico was fascinating and exciting to me. While there I worked in a bioinformatics lab as a research assistant. I loved all of it, the coding and the bioinformatics work. I learned to code in Java. I learned about the several levels of abstraction at which computers operate, from logic gates up to applications. In the bioinformatics lab I learned how to curate and clean genomic data from online resources. I learned about the many visualization tools available for geneticists and how and when to use them. Oh, and a good foundation in bash, for which I am super grateful. I excelled in my coursework and got the opportunity to present a poster of my bioinformatics research findings at a science conference.

I left the undergrad computer science program after I felt I had a good foundation in theory and coding, enough to continue my education at grad school or, as it turns out, a boot camp. (My mentor advised me that pursuing a second undergrad degree wasn’t a good use of my resources.) After moving to NYC and getting married, I decided to pursue data science instead of bioinformatics. My reasoning was that if I became proficient in data science I could work in the field of bioinformatics but also so many other avenues would be open to me. The Data Science Self-paced online program at Flatiron has been awesome so far and I am very excited to see where this journey takes me!
